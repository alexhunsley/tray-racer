# tray-racer

Tray Racer is a toy classical ray tracer written in Go.

## Aims

1. Build up from the simplest possible Ray Tracer by gradually adding features (see 'Part X' commits in git history)

The idea here is for the project to have some educational benefit - anyone interested in classical raytracing can more clearly what addition of various features involves.

2. Utilise Golang's concurrency features to allow simple divison of work between cores

3. At later stages: experiment with speed optimisation features (so we favour faster runtime at possible expense of greater memory usage)
