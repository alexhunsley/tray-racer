# tray-racer

Tray Racer is a toy classical ray tracer written in Go. 

It is a early WIP.

## Aims of completed raytracer

1. Build up from the simplest possible Ray Tracer by gradually adding features - this aspect will happen as part of a re-work once there is enough of a raytracer there.

The idea here is for the project to have some educational benefit - anyone interested in classical raytracing can more clearly what addition of various features involves.

2. Utilise Golang's concurrency features to allow simple divison of work between cores

3. Later stages: experiment with speed optimisation features (in this project I want to favour faster execution at possible expense of greater memory usage)

4. Have fun
